# HydroLedger

## Introduction

HydroLedger is a comprehensive blockchain platform designed to tokenize water bodies and rights into real-world assets (RWAs) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This innovative solution enables secure trading, tracking, and governance of water resources, fostering a decentralized ecosystem that promotes sustainability and efficient resource management. By leveraging blockchain technology, HydroLedger simplifies administrative processes, encourages fractional ownership and investment in water entities, and incentivizes responsible water usage through smart contracts.

At its core, HydroLedger addresses global water challenges by converting physical water resources into digital assets. This not only facilitates transparent and intermediary-free transactions but also integrates advanced technologies for data forecasting and cost optimization. Whether you're an investor, water authority, or environmental advocate, HydroLedger provides tools to enhance resource allocation and predict potential shortages.

### Key Features
- **Tokenization of Water Entities**: Convert water bodies like rivers and reservoirs into RWAs, enabling fractional ownership, investment, and easy trading.
- **NFTs for Water Rights**: Transform water rights into unique NFTs, supporting time-bound leasing, transfers, and management without intermediaries.
- **Native Platform Token (HydroToken)**: Use HydroToken for governance, staking, and covering transaction fees, which helps build a vibrant, decentralized community.
- **Time-Bound Data Sharing**: Implement privacy-compliant mechanisms for sharing usage and quality metrics of tokenized assets, ensuring secure and controlled access.
- **Advanced Gas Optimization**: Employ Dynamic Segmentation Mapping, a cutting-edge technique that reduces blockchain transaction costs by up to 40% through adaptive data partitioning.
- **Real-Time Forecasting with BiLSTM**: Integrate a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to analyze historical and sensor data, providing accurate predictions of water quality, availability, and potential shortages for optimized resource allocation.

HydroLedger not only streamlines operations but also drives sustainable practices by rewarding efficient water use and supporting environmental governance.

## Getting Started

To get started with HydroLedger, you'll need to set up a development environment for blockchain development. This project is built using Solidity for smart contracts and potentially Node.js or Python for off-chain components like the BiLSTM model.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn for package management
- Truffle or Hardhat for Solidity development
- Python (v3.8 or later) for machine learning components

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

This uses historical data to generate forecasts.

For detailed usage examples, refer to the [docs folder](docs/usage.md) in the repository.
